# rust
i'm learning rust. this is the repo where i put the stuff i learned from the rust book @ [rust-lang.org](doc.rust-lang.org/book)

## how do i run?
you first need to compile the program. 

run `rustc <file>.rs` then run `./<programname>`

## hello world.rs
this is just a simple hello world program. but it also shows some basics of rust.
